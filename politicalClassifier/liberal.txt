I agree in 10 years this country will be unrecognizable, just not in a good way.

Republicans have a HUGE portion of the power even though they're not in control of the Senate or a house. In 22 they will most likely regain the Senate for sure and probably the house too. We are fucked.

I honestly don’t think that she truly believes that. Republican voters are on average a lot less educated that Democrats and they know that, they’re trying to spew out whatever they can to fire up their base because they know that their voters will believe everything they say

Abbott is trying too hard to keep his governorship, go back to the wild wild west, and get the NRA to move there. The electric grid failing for millions of customers fixed yet?

Texas voters can wear a side arm while sitting on the roof of their house to threaten the rescue people to pick them up first I guess.
